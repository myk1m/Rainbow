# Rainbow
This is a poem about rainbows, kitty cats, puppy, and James Bond
Red
Orange
Yellow
Green
Blue
Pink
Indigo
Violet
And a cute little orange kitty cat named Garfield
With his best friend that's a puppy named Joseph
They love the rainbow and would watch together whenever they see it
Also James Bond would come along as well
